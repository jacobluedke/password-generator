# Password Generator
## Description
This application lets the user choose which characters they would like to include in their password. Then it randomly generates a password with the options selected. If an incorrect length of password is chosen the user is presented with an error alert, or if the user doesn't select any of the characters an alert pops up letting them know that they need to select at least one option.
