I got though most of the first steps pretty okay, but coming up with the function to go through and select the array 
items was pretty difficult. I didn't know what I didn't know so it was difficult to find the answer I was looking for.
I at least got to the point where there are no errors in the console, but I couldn't get every function to work as stated in the acceptance criteria.

I have a tutor session on Saturday so I will go over it with him so I can figure out the answer and how to unstuck myself with future assignments.
